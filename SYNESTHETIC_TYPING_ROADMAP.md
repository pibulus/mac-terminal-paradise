# 🌈 SYNESTHETIC TYPING ENGINE - ROADMAP
## "Lumines for Every Text Input"

### 🎯 VISION
A pluggable, universal typing experience that transforms any text input into a synesthetic, rhythm-based interface. Like Rez/Tetris Effect/Lumines but for typing.

### 🎮 CORE CONCEPT
- **WPM drives BPM** - Your typing rhythm controls background music tempo
- **Accuracy drives intensity** - Better typing = more visual magic
- **Modular sound banks** - Switch between "magical sparkles" and "mechanical keyboard"
- **Universal compatibility** - Works in any app, framework, or platform

```

### **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**

#### **Web/Electron (Current)**
- ✅ DOM manipulation for effects
- ✅ Web Audio API for sounds
- ✅ Works in any browser/Electron app

#### **Deno/Fresh**
- 🔄 Server-side components for analytics
- 🔄 Client-side effects via islands
- 🔄 WebAssembly for performance-critical parts

#### **Svelte/React/Vue**
- 🔄 Framework-specific wrappers
- 🔄 Component-based integration
- 🔄 State management integration

## 📊 INTENSITY CURVE SYSTEM (JUST FIXED!)

### **Before (TOO INTENSE):**
- Every keystroke = Full rainbow explosion
- Couldn't read text
- Performance issues

### **After (SMART CURVE):**
```javascript
// 0-1 intensity based on typing speed
const intensity = (300 - typingSpeed) / 300;

// Tiered effect system:
if (intensity > 0.3) createBasicTrail()     // Gentle start
if (intensity > 0.5) createSparkles()       // Getting excited  
if (intensity > 0.7) createAsciiEffects()   // Full magic mode
if (intensity > 0.9) createBonusEffects()   // God-tier typing
```

### **Benefits:**
- 📖 **Readable at slow speeds** - Subtle effects only
- ⚡ **Exciting at fast speeds** - Full rainbow cascade
- 🎯 **Performance scaled** - More effects = better typing
- 🧠 **Neurologically satisfying** - Visual feedback matches skill

## 🎵 AUDIO-VISUAL SYNC SYSTEM

### **WPM → BPM Mapping:**
```
20 WPM = 60 BPM   (Slow ambient)
40 WPM = 80 BPM   (Chill beats) 
60 WPM = 100 BPM  (Upbeat tempo)
80 WPM = 120 BPM  (Dance energy)
100+ WPM = 140+ BPM (Hyperspeed)
```

### **Rhythm Detection:**
- Detect consistent typing patterns
- Match background drone/beats to typing rhythm  
- Visual effects pulse with musical beats
- Create "flow state" through audio-visual harmony

### **Sound Bank Architecture:**
```javascript
const soundBank = {
  name: "MagicalSparkles",
  keyPress: [sound1, sound2, sound3],     // Random selection
  wordComplete: wordSound,                 // Special trigger
  lineComplete: lineSound,                 // Achievement sound
  backgroundDrone: droneLoop,             // Ambient layer
  tempoRange: [60, 120]                   // BPM compatibility
}
```
